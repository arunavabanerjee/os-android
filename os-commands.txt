The Android software development kit (SDK) includes different components, including SDK Tools, Build Tools, and Platform Tools. 
The SDK Tools primarily includes the stock Android emulator, hierarchy viewer, SDK manager, and ProGuard. 
The Build Tools primarily include aapt (Android packaging tool to create .APK), dx (Android tool that converts .java files 
to .dex files). 
Platform Tools include the Android debug shell, sqlite3 and Systrace.
